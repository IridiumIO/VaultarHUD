Adds a HUD opposite the bounty table HUD (when you press `Tab`) that shows a similar progress bar for items towards your current vault crystal. Required items that have variants (e.g. `Oak logs`, `Birch logs`) will cycle through the options automatically. 

**Installation:**
 - Drop the jar file into your `mods` folder and restart the game. 
 - Press and hold `TAB` in game after you right-click an altar. 

**Caveats**
  - Probably doesn't work on servers (or will require the mod to be installed on the server as well - not tested)

**Todo:**
- Add alternative condensed view similar to the script version, and configuration option to switch between them
- Possibly add a second overlayed progress bar in a different colour that counts items that match in your inventory
