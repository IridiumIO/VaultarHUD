*For the Vault Hunters Minecraft Modpack*


Adds a HUD opposite the bounty table HUD (when you press `Tab`) that shows a similar progress bar for items towards your current vault crystal. Required items that have variants (e.g. `Oak logs`, `Birch logs`) will cycle through the options automatically. 

**Installation:**
 - Drop the jar file into your `mods` folder and restart the game. 
 - Press and hold `TAB` in game, or open any inventory screen. Can be toggled using `0` by default (hotkeys can be changed in the standard keybinding screen)


Also works on multiplayer servers _even if the server doesn't have the mod installed_
 - However, if the server doesn't have the mod installed, you will have to right-click an altar to update the HUD - it cannot update automatically as that requires communication with the server. 



**Todo:**
- Allow switching between your altar and another player's altar
