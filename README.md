*For the Vault Hunters Minecraft Modpack*


Adds a HUD opposite the bounty table HUD (when you press `Tab`) that shows a similar progress bar for items towards your current vault crystal. Required items that have variants (e.g. `Oak logs`, `Birch logs`) will cycle through the options automatically. 

**Installation:**
 - Drop the jar file into your `mods` folder and restart the game. 
 - Press and hold `TAB` in game after you right-click an altar. 


Also works on multiplayer servers _even if the server doesn't have the mod installed_
 - However, if the server doesn't have the mod installed, you will have to right-click an altar to update the HUD - it cannot update automatically as that requires communication with the server. 



**Todo:**
- Add alternative condensed view similar to the script version, and configuration option to switch between them / show up in your inventory
- Possibly add a second overlayed progress bar in a different colour that counts items that match in your inventory
- Rebindable hotkey for showing the HUD
- Allow switching between your altar and another player's altar
